# Furry &amp; Wrath

## Description

[Furry & Wrath](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=game.furryandwrath.app&hl=en) is a violent puzzle game about vengeance and fur, and it is not meant to be played by kids.

By downloading and playing this game you accept the terms of [End-User License Agreement](eula).

## Why does this game require write permissions?

In order to save and load your game progress. Saved progress requires 285 bytes of storage. I can't tell you the exact location of save file, but it is somewhere around indie/furryandwrath on your SD-card. Probably. (please, read the [SDL2](https://libsdl.org) documentation for details)

## Why is this game free? Is there any hidden functionality?

There is no hidden functionality at all. It doesn't even use your network connection. This might change later, if and when achievements and leaderboards are added (it depends on how many people like this game and my overall level of lazyness).

So why is this game free (free as in "free beer", not as in "freedom")?

I'm not willing to monetize this game, because originally this game was not my idea. My friend and I wanted to sell it on App Store.
But circumstances changed. He can't participate anymore. So yeah... But I don't want 1.5 years of development to be in vain, I want this game to be played. So there you go, here's your answer (even if you didn't ask hehe)
